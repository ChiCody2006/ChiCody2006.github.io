            <p>
                For my next game I wanted to do something a little more advanced, and so I decided to create a platformer, like most game developers do 
                when starting off. The concept was created based on the premise that a game idea should be able to be described in one sentence, and 
                are usually a simple genre of a game but with a twist. My twist was going to be that the player could control the direction of 
                any moving object (sentence would be: "A platformer where the player can control the direction of any moving object.")
            </p>

                        Since this is a prototype to try and flesh out how the game will look/feel first, and to test if the game idea is even fun,
                        I just needed a quick background and ground using tile maps, plus a random shape for the player for now. I got the background 
                        tiles from the Unity asset store (<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/nature-pixel-art-base-assets-free-151370">here</a>) and colored in the tiles myself using a tile palette made of these tiles.

                        I coded out the basic player movement (Unity has an Input Manager that takes in names like Horizontal and Jump), 
                        so that was very simple. However, I wanted to add two things to the movement that would allow for a smoother feel and 
                        an easier time testing- Coyote time and Jump Buffer. Coyote time is the time that you have to jump after you are no longer 
                        standing on the ground, and you can see this in games like Celeste or Hollow Knight. Jump buffer is a time before a jump where 
                        the player can press the jump button and still jump even if they are not on the ground. I also added something that controls 
                        the height you go depending on how long the jump button is pressed.

                        Next, since all I've been doing to explain my game's rules are a rule sheet, I wanted to make a tutorial that would guide
                        the player through the controls using pop-ups instead of having a bunch of text explaining what the rules are. I wanted to make 
                        a pop-up for the left-right movement of the player, one for jumping, and one for the main mechanic, changing vectors. I wanted 
                        to have the player change the vector of themselves and that's why I made the design a giant hole. I used an array for the 
                        pop-ups so that they would come in order, but the index had to be outside because the update function runs once every frame.

                        Normally the logic manager keeps track of more, but in this case it is a prototype so I only needed it to reset the player in 
                        case it fell off.

                        The main mechanic was the hardest to code by far, partially because for the initial Change Vector Script(something that I
                        can later attach to any object I want the player to control) I was not using Fixed Update for any velocity changes or physics 
                        updates because I wasn't sure how to connect the Update and FixedUpdate functions in Unity. I also tried to set the velocity, 
                        which doesn't work out. The code ended up only working in the y direction with the x-direction not moving at all.

                        After trying and failing to set the velocity directly to something, I gave up and looked for any alternatives to move objects.
                        Transform.translate, adding to rigidbody velocity, multiplying, etc. and I finally found one that worked. It was the add force 
                        function. After testing out the different force modes of the function, I settled on the default. I also used a lot of booleans 
                        and other float variables to connect my FixedUpdate to my Update. This was important because FixedUpdate, being physics based, 
                        did not work well when I stopped the time in my game to make it easier for the player to aim. That was Update's job, so I had 
                        to try and connect the two. I also got rid of using the OnMouseDown functions because they could not relate to time, and that 
                        made it so I could click anywhere on the screen instead of just the object to move it, so I had to add RayCasts to the code so 
                        that it would know what my mouse clicked.
