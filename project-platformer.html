            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>For the hackathon, I needed something that would be easy and quick to make, and that was already fun, as I didn't have the time
                to come up with an original idea and make prototypes to test if it's fun. However, the game also had to be complex enough to 
                allow for other ideas to come in as well. That is why I chose the game Pong, as I already had a unique spin(pun intended) in mind 
                for the game. The basic idea was to add the ability to rotate the paddles while playing.
