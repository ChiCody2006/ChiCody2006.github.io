Website for Game Development Log

Most of the content in subpage Spong and subpage Vectors(another game that I am working on, name subject to change)

Here is the link to the website: https://chicody2006.github.io/

Githubs of both games are also in the website pages.

All of the content in the html files and css files were done manually by me because I wanted the experience with working in css.
The Javascript was from a tutorial on changing the format of the navbar into a burger menu so that mobile users could read it better.
